    "Primary keys are unique identifiers for each row in a table. They are used to ensure that each row in a table is unique. Foreign keys are used to link two tables together. They are used to ensure that the value in a column in one table is present in another table. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have already created a `students` table. For our next move we will create an `awards` table. This table will contain information about awards that students have won. Each award can only be given to one student, so we will need to link the `awards` table to the `students` table. This saves us from duplicating the relevant information about a student in the `awards` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create the `awards` table with the following columns:\n",
    "- `award_id` - a unique identifier for each award\n",
    "- `student_id` - the id of the student who won the award. This is a foreign key that links to the `students` table\n",
    "- `award_name` - the name of the award\n",
    "- `award_date` - the date the award was won (defaulting to the current date)\n"
