    "## Databases ##\n",
    "**Databases** are a collection of data that is stored in a computer system. Databases allow us to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. Databases are used in many applications, such as websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications. Databases use tables to store data. Each table has columns and rows. Columns represent the *attributes* of the data, and rows represent *individual records*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL ##\n",
    "**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a programming language used to interact with databases. SQL allows us to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. SQL is used to perform operations on databases, such as querying data, inserting data, updating data, and deleting data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The basic SQL commands are:**\n",
    "- `SELECT`: Used to retrieve data from a database.\n",
    "- `INSERT`: Used to insert data into a database.\n",
    "- `UPDATE`: Used to update data in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "## Part 1 - Creating a table##\n",
    "In the code below we will:\n",
    "1. Connect to a new database (school.db) using duckdb.\n",
    "2. Create a table called 'test' with one column: \"num\" which stores an integer. *Integers are whole numbers (ie. positive or negative but not a decimal)*\n",
    "3. Insert some data into this table \n",
    "4. Query the table to see what we have inserted. \n",
    "5. Update the data in the table and query again to see the changes.\n",

    "## Additional SQL Commands ##\n",
    "In addition to `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE`, there are other SQL commands that can be used to interact with databases. We already saw how to create a table, but there are also commands to delete a table (`DROP TABLE`), delete data from a table (`DELETE FROM`), and alter a table (`ALTER TABLE`). These commands can be used to modify the structure of a database, add or remove data, and perform other operations.\n",

    "4. Delete some of the data from the table and query again to see the changes.\n",
